 * Testcase Example:  '5'
 *
 * You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape,
 * where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
 * ⁠
 * Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
 *
 * n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed
 * integer.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * n = 5
 *
 * The coins can form the following rows:
 * ¤
 * ¤ ¤
 * ¤ ¤
 *
 * Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * n = 8
 *
 * The coins can form the following rows:
 * ¤
 * ¤ ¤
 * ¤ ¤ ¤
 * ¤ ¤
 *
 * Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
